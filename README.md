------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AdvancedSelect includes an array of new commands for Praat,
which are installed in different menus
(refer to the setup file to check the name and location of these commands).

How to install AdvancedSelect as a Praat plugin in a permanent fashion:
1. Go to your Praat preferences folder.
   This is always under your user folder, but the location varies depending on your operating system.
   (In each case, change user_name for your actual user name).
   --On Windows, go to C:\Users\user_name\Praat
   --On Mac, go to /Users/user_name/Library/Preferences/Praat Prefs/ (You may need to make invisible folders visible by pressing Command+Shift+Period)
   --On Linux, go to /home/user_name/.praat-dir
2. Create a subfolder named plugin_AdvancedSelect
   (this is case-sensitive).
3. Copy all the AdvancedSelect files into that subfolder.
   You are ready to go.
   Next time you open Praat, the AdvancedSelect commands will appear in their corresponding menus.
